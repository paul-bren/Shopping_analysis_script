"# Python-Scripts" 

This script will do a basic analysis of banking transactions. Please note - you need to start the docker engine and then enable containers starting with 5a and 47. Then log into the php admin console using localhost:83. You will then need to download the csv file from '' and save it as an xlsx file.
Name it whatever you want. Then change the path/name of the workbook path within the python code. That's it!!

One other thing, change 'mystring' values to match your criteria.
